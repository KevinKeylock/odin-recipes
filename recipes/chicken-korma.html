<!-- 6 steps to the ordered list -->

 <h2>Steps:</h2>
 <ol class="steps">
    <li>
        <h3>1. Make the almond paste:</h3>
        <p>Soak the almonds in 1/2 cup water for approximately 2 hours. Peel the skins off.</p>
        <p>In a blender (I use Nutribullet) grind the almonds into a smooth paste.</p>
        <p>Feel free to add 1-2 tablespoons of additional water to help with a smooth grinding.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>2. Marinade the chicken:</h3>
        <p>In a medium-sized mixing bowl combine yogurt, turmeric, ginger garlic paste, salt, and cayenne pepper. Using a spoon or a whisk, mix it all together. Add chicken to the marinade. Coat the chicken well with marinade. Cover with a plate and set aside in the refrigerator for 1 hour.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>3. Fry the onions:</h3>
        <p>Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Line a plate or sheet pan with paper towels and set this near the stove. Check to see if the oil is hot enough by dropping a strand of onion into the pot. If it sizzles then the oil is ready. Add the rest of the onions to the pot. Cook for 7-10 minutes on medium-high heat while moving them around until the onions turn golden brown. Use a slotted spoon to take the onions out of the oil and spread into the paper-towel-lined plate or sheet pan lined to soak up the excess oil. Set aside for later. You will use these onions to make a paste. Leave about 1 tablespoon of oil in the pot and discard the rest.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>4. Start cooking the chicken:</h3>
        <p>Add cardamom, peppercorn, cinnamon, cloves, and bay leaf to the pot with the oil and reduce the heat to medium. Gently stir. Add chicken, and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5-8 minutes, until the chicken turns opaque.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>5. Make the onion paste:</h3>
        <p>In a blender or food processor, add the fried onions and a couple of tablespoons of water. Pulse until it becomes a coarse paste. Add the fried onion paste, salt, and coriander to the pot with the chicken. Mix everything together. Cover and let it simmer for 5-8 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>6. Finish the dish:</h3>
        <p>Remove the lid, and add the yogurt, almond paste, and shredded coconut (if using). Stir well. Cook on medium-high heat (uncovered) for another 2-3 minutes, until the sauce turns creamy and oil starts to separate.</p>

        <p>Garnish with almonds and cilantro. Serve with hot naan or lachcha paratha.</p>
