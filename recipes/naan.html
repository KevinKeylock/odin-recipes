    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="desc">Make these Naan that are deliciously soft and slightly chewy made without yeast. Naan are flatbreads made with leavened dough and popular in India and some South Asian countries. My tried and tested recipe is for you if you find that using yeast is a daunting affair. So this Naan recipe fits in as it is incredibly easy to make. You can cook naan on a griddle (tawa) or a skillet on a stovetop. Alternatively grill them in a tandoor or oven. Here I show 2 ways of roasting them – on the stove-top with direct flame and on the skillet.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>1 cup lukewarm milk</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
        <li>4 cups all-purpose flour, plus extra for dusting</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup plain yogurt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil or canola oil, plus extra for greasing the bowl</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol class="steps">
        <li>
            <h3>1. Prepare a bowl:</h3>
            <p>Lightly grease a large bowl with a little bit of oil. You will put your dough in this bowl to let it rise. Set the bowl aside.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>2. Prepare the yeast:</h3>
            <p>In a liquid measuring cup or a small mixing bowl, combine the lukewarm milk, sugar, and active dry yeast. The milk should be just warm to the touch. If it’s too hot you can kill the yeast. Let it sit for 5 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>3. Make the dough:</h3>
            <p>In another large mixing bowl, whisk the flour and salt together. Add yogurt, oil and milk-yeast mixture. Use a wooden spoon or your hands to combine the dough. The dough should be soft and sticky at this point.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>4. Knead the dough:</h3>
            <p>Dust your countertop with flour. Transfer the dough to the counter. Knead together until a soft dough forms, about 5 minutes. If the dough feels dry and is too tough to knead, add about 1-2 tablespoons of water, a little bit at a time, until the dough is easier to work with.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>5. Let the dough rise:</h3>
            <p>Transfer the dough to the greased bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a damp towel. Place in a dark, warm, dry place. I place it in my oven (it’s not on) to let it rise, but your countertop is fine. Let the dough rise for 3 to 4 hours or until it more than doubles in size.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>6. Punch down the dough and let it rise again:</h3>
            <p>Punch the risen dough down. Knead for another minute. Return the dough to the bowl, cover it again and let it rise for another 45 minutes to 1 hour.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>7. Divide the dough:</h3>
            <p>Dust your countertop with flour. Turn the dough out onto the counter and knead it for another minute or two until it's smooth. Divide the dough into 16 smaller balls of equal size (about 2 ounces each). Using a rolling pin, roll the balls into a teardrop shape. About 2 to 3 inches wide, 6 to 7 inches long, and about 1/8 inch thick. They don’t have to be perfectly uniform.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>8. Cook the naan:</h3>
            <p>If using herbs or spices, sprinkle one side of the bread with those now. Brush the other side with water. Set a medium-sized heavy pan or cast iron skillet with a lid over medium-high heat. Check the heat of the pan by flicking water on it. If it evaporates on contact, it’s ready. Once the pan is hot, place the naan wet side down into the skillet. Cover it with a lid. Let it cook for about 30 seconds or until you see bubbles on it. Flip the naan, brush it with butter or ghee, and cook it uncovered for another 10 seconds. Serve it hot.</p>
